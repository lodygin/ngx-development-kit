# ngx-development-kit

### What is it?
ngx-development-kit is a library of tools designed to accelerate the development of Angular applications.

### Why might you need it?
Developing Angular applications often involves implementing common features like destroy services, memoization pipes, and track-by-property directives.
The purpose of the ngx-development-kit library is collecting these tools in one place and makes them available as ready-to-use utilities.
This can significantly reduce the time and effort required to develop applications. 
Instead of copying and pasting solutions from one project to another, you can use the ngx-development-kit library to quickly and easily integrate these features into your application.
